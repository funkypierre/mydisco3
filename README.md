# mydisco3
Do you like the incredible nichesque activity of making albums list ?
Do you also like using Topsters2 to share the pictures on Twitter and gets 0 likes ?
Well I'm trying to build a better one.
A faster one, with more swag.

~~~~~~~~ Storytime

MyDisco is a personal dev project of mine that never came up because I suck.

One day I thought : instead of making a basic personal note on my phone for my top albums of each new year, I could make an app to have all covers beautifully aligned.

The first version codebase is still pinned on my Github. It's a messy Rails monolith.
I dropped it when I started an internship (I prefer to do other activites after work)

The second version never really came up. I tried to add Vue.js with my Rails API.
I dropped it when I finished school and didn't need some pending credits anymore to pass the year lmao got'eem.

But now I'm an accomplished developer (at least I try) and I have better ideas than before for this app.
Maybe this time it will really come around ??? Stay tuned.
